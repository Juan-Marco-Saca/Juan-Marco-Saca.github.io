      <h2>About This Website</h2>
      <p>I am Juan Marco Saca. I am a Computer Science student at St. Mary's University. I enjoy solving problems while creating things! Also, I want to be learning moreâ€”whether it's through a book, a new idea, or what fun things are around us. When I'm not programming or working on some projects, I'm probably reading, traveling, or trying to utilize my skills in my favorite video games! This website will be focused on me, and mostly on what my journey has been as a learner, creator, explorer, and person. I hope you enjoy your visit, and I hope you look around and get to know me!</p>
