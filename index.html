      <h2>About This Website</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my website! I’m Juan Marco Saca, a Computer Science student at St. Mary’s University with a passion for solving problems and creating innovative solutions. Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I’m always looking to expand my horizons—whether it’s through reading, exploring new ideas, or seeking fun and exciting experiences. When I’m not coding or tackling projects, you’ll likely find me immersed in a great book, traveling to new destinations, or enjoying a challenge in my favorite video games. This site is a reflection of who I am—both as a dedicated learner and as someone who values creativity, exploration, and connection. I’m glad you’re here—take a look around and get to know me!</p>
