			<div class="project">
				<h3>Almacenes Siman Systems Department Intern</h3>
				<p> As part of my internship at Almacenes Siman, I created and carried out an entirely simulated phishing email campaign in Central America, 
			leveraging Windows Defender Campaign Builder to evaluate employee security awareness. I also developed a phishing awareness manual to help 
			employees identify fraudulent emails and reduce risk to the organization. I gathered metrics and analyzed the campaign's performance, identified 
			users targets, and provided the Systems Manager with insightful recommendations. Finally, I researched, instaled, and trialled observability tools 
			such as OpenTelemetry and Prometheus in Spring Boot applications, wrote a comparative analysis, and created recommendations for tools to use to monitor 
			their bigger enterprise system. Through this digging I felt solidified in my knowledge not only in software monitoring, but also system performance evaluations, 
			and best practices for observability in cloud-native environments.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
                <p>While at St. Mary's University, I created and programmed a Tic Tac Toe game in C, highlighting my abilities 
				to use bidimensional arrays, pointers, and multiple methods. The program provided options for users to play against 
				each other or in a two-play mode against an intelligent computer algorithm I designed myself, greatly showing my prowess 
				in problem-solving and strategy. Part of this project, I wrote a program that parsed input sentences and converted words to 
				Pig Latin experience, building my exposure to string manipulation and designing a specific algorithm.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>VolleyPoints</h3>
                <p>I developed VolleyPoints, a Java-based application for viewing and collecting real-time data on volleyball matches. 
				The application I developed had an intuitive interface to allow users to consume match events via a button or hotkeys, 
				increasing the efficiency of user interaction during real-time matches. The program collected the game data from the database, 
				generated datasets, and presented the results in the form of bar graphs for ease of analysis. I worked directly with the team manager, 
				and in addition to a schedule meeting every month, I participated in several other meetings in which we refining application requirements 
				and features, and assessed costs for the features we requested. Through this experience, I gained valuable experience with object-oriented 
				programming, data visualization, and client-focused software development.</p>

                <p>St. Mary’s University, San Antonio, TX (August 2024 – Present)<br>
				My role as a Resident Assistant is to develop an inclusive and welcoming community among the residents of the residence halls. 
				I aim to be visible with residents in various ways to make them feel comfortable, challenge them to think about different ideas, 
				and foster collaboration through trust building activities. I also heavily rely on active listening and through a variety of perspectives that 
				are incorporated into our annual events. This continuous engagement creates a supportive and inclusive living environment and community for the residents.</p>

                <p>Colegio Lamatepec, San Salvador, El Salvador (January 2021 – June 2023)<br>
				I started a Photography Club at Colegio Lamatepec, providing students a chance to learn about and pursue their interest in photography.
				I taught about ten teenagers, for two years, basic photography skills and writing captions, encouraging them to be creative and artistic. 
				Running the club challenged me with time conflicts and technical difficulties, and it helped develop my adaptability for taking on opportunities when they appeared.</p>
