            <p>Books have always interested me because they are lifetime knowledge from someone in a few pages 
			(some time more than a few, but still less than a lifetime). Readings is not just a hobby is one way I
			learn, grow, and discover different topics that are not taught in classes. If its a fiction or non-fiction 
			book there is always something new and special to learn.</p>

            <p>Traveling is one of my favorite if not my favorite hobby, it allows me to meet different people, 
			learn and expirience different cultures, and just explore wonderful places we have in our world. It 
			fuels my curiosity and my advetorus side from going into deep caves, to flying over a city in the middle 
			of the Alpes, to seeing a small town.</p>

			like paragliding or horseback riding, all these thing just fill me with thrill and excitment. My bucket list 
			is full of different activites and things I want to try in my life.</p>
